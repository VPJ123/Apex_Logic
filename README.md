# Supplier Spend for Current Year Project

This project is a real-world example of creating an Apex trigger that updates a custom field named `Total_Spend_for_Current_Year__c` on a custom object named `Supplier__c`.

The trigger contains logic to filter and aggregate spend data **only for the current year** by extracting the year portion of the `Spend_Date__c` field.

It runs on the following DML actions: **insert**, **update**, and **delete**.
